## Problem1  Repeated DNA Sequences (https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/)


## Problem2 Favourite Genres (https://leetcode.com/playground/Z3VJa4bn)

Given a map Map<String, List<String>> userSongs with user names as keys and a list of all the songs that the user has listened to as values.


Also given a map Map<String, List<String>> songGenres, with song genre as keys and a list of all the songs within that genre as values. The song can only belong to only one genre.


The task is to return a map Map<String, List<String>>, where the key is a user name and the value is a list of the user's favorite genre(s). Favorite genre is the most listened to genre. A user can have more than one favorite genre if he/she has listened to the same number of songs per each of the genres.


Example 1:


Input:

userSongs = {  

   "David": ["song1", "song2", "song3", "song4", "song8"],

   "Emma":  ["song5", "song6", "song7"]

},

songGenres = {  

   "Rock":    ["song1", "song3"],

   "Dubstep": ["song7"],

   "Techno":  ["song2", "song4"],

   "Pop":     ["song5", "song6"],

   "Jazz":    ["song8", "song9"]

}


Output: {  

   "David": ["Rock", "Techno"],

   "Emma":  ["Pop"]

}


Explanation:

David has 2 Rock, 2 Techno and 1 Jazz song. So he has 2 favorite genres.

Emma has 2 Pop and 1 Dubstep song. Pop is Emma's favorite genre.

public class Main {

    public static Map<String, List<String>> favoritegenre(Map<String, List<String>> userMap, Map<String, List<String>> genreMap) {

    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
            HashMap<String, List<String>> userSongs = new HashMap<>();

            userSongs.put("David", Arrays.asList(new String[]{"song1", "song2", "song3", "song4", "song8"}));

            userSongs.put("Emma", Arrays.asList(new String[]{"song5", "song6", "song7"}));

            HashMap<String, List<String>> songGenres = new HashMap<>();

            songGenres.put("Rock", Arrays.asList(new String[]{"song1", "song3"}));

            songGenres.put("Dubstep", Arrays.asList(new String[]{"song7"}));

            songGenres.put("Techno", Arrays.asList(new String[]{"song2", "song4"}));

            songGenres.put("Pop", Arrays.asList(new String[]{"song5", "song6"}));

            songGenres.put("Jazz", Arrays.asList(new String[]{"song8", "song9"}));

            Map<String, List<String>> res = favoritegenre(userSongs, songGenres);

            System.out.println(res);
    }

}
